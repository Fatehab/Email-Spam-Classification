# Email-Spam-Classification
This project is about classifying emails as either spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify spam emails and distinguish them from legitimate emails. The dataset used in this project contains 5172 emails, which are labeled as either spam or not spam.

To achieve this goal, the study applied several machine learning algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. The Logistic Regression algorithm was found to be the most efficient and consistent, achieving an accuracy of 97.53% in classifying the emails as spam or not spam.

The study suggests that the logistic regression classifier is not only rapid and consistent, but it can also be used for examining classification across several groups of response variables using input variables. The other models used in the study also achieved high accuracy levels above 90% in detecting spam emails.

In summary, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in detecting spam emails with high accuracy levels. The results achieved by the various models tested in the study could be used to develop more robust email filtering systems that can accurately identify and block spam emails.
